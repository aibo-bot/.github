## Hi there 👋

Welcome to aibo's official open-source organization!

aibo is a discord bot, built with the sole purpose of engaging **large** communities with all sorts of games, from daily qotds, truth or dares, to even emulating classic gameboy games on discord.

aibo also comes with its own global currency, built to spend wherever you like on discord, to unlock super cool goodies and prizes within the aibo platform!
